  //obj.totalTime = x
  
  //obj.usedTime = 0
  //obj.remainingTime = obj.totalTime
  //Maybe an obj.type, which tells what kind of task it is (for example, the shower task would have a different type than the personal/work periods)?
  //^PROBABLY A YES TO THE OBJ TYPE, to be used for the nuances of the tasks. Probably a few more obj properties as well, some maybe exclusive to certain object types.
//}
//obj.usedTime = ...
//obj.remainingTime = totalTime - usedTime
//finish task button
//add time if task wasn't finished before remainingTime = 0
  
//function task(obj) {
  //do the task, render it, etc., using the obj's properties as input
//}
  
//function schedule() { //Schedule function is the main schedule, that triggers the task() function for each task
  //task(shower)
  //while true {
    //task(personal)
    //task(work)
  //}
//}
  
//TO-DO:
//1. Add nuance obj properties and types; basically get the objs working
//2. The graphics (HTML, CSS, simple JS, etc.)
  
  
//THE ONLY POSSIBLE ADDED TYPE IS THE WINDOW TYPE, WHERE THE totalTime IS AN INEQUALITY/RANGE/WINDOW
//-Effects totalTime and adding time
//THE SHOWER TASK, LIKE ANY TASK, HAS THE APPROXIMATE TIME REQUIRED AS THE totalTime, WITH THE USER TRYING TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE, FINISHING THE TASK BEFORE THAT TIME (FINISH TASK BUTTON)
//AS PREVIOUSLY STATED ABOVE, THE WINDOW TASKS MIGHT BE THERE OWN TYPE, AFFECTING HOW THEIR totalTime and "FINISH TASK" ACTION WORKS
