  //Maybe an obj.type, which tells what kind of task it is (for example, the shower task would have a different type than the personal/work periods)?
  //^PROBABLY A YES TO THE OBJ TYPE, to be used for the nuances of the tasks. Probably a few more obj properties as well, some maybe exclusive to certain object types.
//}
//obj.usedTime = ...
//obj.remainingTime = totalTime - usedTime
//finish task button
//add time if task wasn't finished before remainingTime = 0
  
//function task(obj) {
  //do the task, render it, etc., using the obj's properties as input
//}
  
//function schedule() { //Schedule function is the main schedule, that triggers the task() function for each task
  //task(shower)
  //while true {
    //task(personal)
    //task(work)
  //}
//}
  
//TO-DO:
//1. Add nuance obj properties and types; basically get the objs working
