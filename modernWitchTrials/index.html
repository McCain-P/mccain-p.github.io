					Introduction
				</h2>
				<p>
					The Internet’s ability to create isolated and radicalized groups of individuals has led to the modern phenomenon of a hysteria fueled by intolerance of ideas and cultures vastly alien to those of one’s own, where the identity of the modern “witches” depends on one’s perspective. This medium, which could be described as graphic design that can be inherently interacted with by the viewer, hosts mainly text and other forms of visual media. The "Era Switch" button in the right-hand side of the footer can be used to switch between the modern and premodern eras, allowing you to juxtapose the mirror images of Salem and isolated Internet communities.

				<h2>
					Isolation as an Instigator
				</h2>
				<p id="isolationSection">
					The seeking of a place of belonging, caused by isolation and alienation, leads to further voluntary isolation. Individuals who isolate themselves start to become more susceptible to persuasion, leading down a path of radicalization. Some people who perceive themselves as outsiders will search for a sense of belonging, leading them to communities where they will show strong disdain for those considered outsiders of this new community- those who once ostracized him/her. In this perspective, isolation and alienation are sort of cyclic motifs that are both the cause and effect of people joining these communities.

				<h2>
					Recurring Motifs
				</h2>
				<p id="recurringMotifsSection">
					This discussion focuses around the shared motifs of intolerance and hysteria; the natural formation of isolated and radical Internet communities is characterized by a hysteria of intolerance. Intolerance and hysteria generated from isolated and radicalized communities created by the Internet leads to a partial divide of what used to be a more unified people. It's interesting how stories and series of events can be simplified down to just being manifestations of a few intangible concepts.

				<h2>
					Closing Thoughts
				</h2>
				<p>
					The fact that this sort of situation has occurred multiple times under completely separate circumstances shows that this is not a phenomenon unique to the 21st century; the Internet is solely a catalyst that accelerates and amplifies things that can happen as a result of human nature. The most important takeaway isn't that you're supposed to acknowledge the existence of these communities and what causes them, it's that you have to think if the perspective you've assumed on this topic is the right one- amidst a landscape shaped by alienation, which parties are really wrong?
