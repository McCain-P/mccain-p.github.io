  //obj.usedTime = 0
  //obj.remainingTime = obj.totalTime
  //Maybe an obj.type, which tells what kind of task it is (for example, the shower task would have a different type than the personal/work periods)?
  //^PROBABLY A YES TO THE OBJ TYPE, to be used for the nuances of the tasks. Probably a few more obj properties as well, some maybe exclusive to certain object types.
//}
//obj.usedTime = ...
//obj.remainingTime = totalTime - usedTime
//finish task button
//add time if task wasn't finished before remainingTime = 0
  
//function task(obj) {
  //do the task, render it, etc., using the obj's properties as input
//}
  
//function schedule() { //Schedule function is the main schedule, that triggers the task() function for each task
  //task(shower)
  //while true {
    //task(personal)
    //task(work)
  //}
//}
  
//TO-DO:
//1. Add nuance obj properties and types; basically get the objs working. Classes and declaring objects and their properties
//2. A function that loads a seperate JS script that is the schedule. This basically loads the schedule you want into the program. The schedule file has the general schedule function, all the objects, and calls the schedule function. This allows the entirety of schedules to be completely relative to each indiviudal schedule, while using the main framework in the program.
// ^ MAKE IT AN XML FILE. HAVE TO ADD other options such as having sub-objects (like how shower, excersize, brushing teeth, etc. would be sub-objects of the "morning" object), having multiple objects at the same time, having conditional statements that have to be met for an object to be completed (for example, if, or, and, etc. statements about what sub-objects have to be completed), objects that have to be done a certain amount of times, objects that are called after the completion of a certain object, when objects are called, etc. etc. Basically, adding more properties, types, specifications, etc. to how objects function, are executed, and are related to other objects.
//3. The graphics (HTML, CSS, simple JS, etc.)
  
  
//THE ONLY POSSIBLE ADDED TYPE IS THE WINDOW TYPE, WHERE THE totalTime IS AN INEQUALITY/RANGE/WINDOW
//-Effects totalTime, and the "adding time" and "finish task" actions
//THE SHOWER TASK, LIKE ANY TASK, HAS THE APPROXIMATE TIME REQUIRED AS THE totalTime (5 mins, in this case), WITH THE USER TRYING TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE, FINISHING THE TASK BEFORE THAT TIME (FINISH TASK BUTTON)
//AS PREVIOUSLY STATED ABOVE, THE WINDOW TASKS MIGHT BE THEIR OWN TYPE, AFFECTING HOW THEIR totalTime, and "FINISH TASK" and "ADD TIME" ACTIONS WORK
