*The isolated document () yielded that the error did not occur for any of the images/classes in it (class="artork", class="otherClassName, no class)
-Error didn't occur when the "artwork" class wasn't referrenced in the CSS
-Error didn't occur when the "artwork" class was referrenced in the CSS, with position: absolte
Conclusion: There is something in the code of the original document that is causing the error with the "artwork" class name
-> Conclusion: Could possibly be that the other class names that start with "artwork" ("artworkHeading", etc.) could be causing this (possibly like some CSS identifier like).

Important conlcusions
1. The error is that the "onclick" attribute of an element is not executing the code within it when the image is clicked
2. The error is caused by giving the element the "artwork" class name in the class attribute.
*If the name of the CSS class is switched (just changing the name, not the code) from "artwork" to something else, the error is fixed and does not occur
3. The error with the "artwork" class name is caused by code in the original HTML document
