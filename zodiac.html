  /*
  Unicode Replacement Character U+FFFD � is used for when the character is not available (for example, if an input character does not currently have a corresponding output character yet)
  
  "Transient" characters (Unicode non-characters) at the end of the encoding key are used so that ASCII output characters aren't confused for ASCII input characters and further encoded. The ASCII input characters are first encoded to their respective transient characters, which are then encoded to the respective ASCII output characters at the end of the encoding key.
    G transient character: U+FDD0 ﷐
    V transient character: U+FDD1 ﷑
    J transient character: U+FDD2 ﷒
    R transient character: U+FDD3 ﷓
    A transient character: U+FDD4 ﷔

  //Multiple Zodiac characters represent the same latin character. So, for example, A could be converted into like 3 different zodiac characters. Will have to update the function (possibly), to pick between the multiple random characters (maybe randomly, or with some pattern).
