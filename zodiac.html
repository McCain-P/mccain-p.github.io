  Unicode Replacement Character U+FFFD � is used for when the character is not available (for example, if an input character does not currently have a corresponding output character yet)
  
  "Transient" characters (Unicode non-characters) at the end of the encoding key are used so that ASCII output characters aren't confused for ASCII input characters and further encoded. The ASCII input characters are first encoded to their respective transient characters, which are then encoded to the respective ASCII output characters at the end of the encoding key.
    G transient character: U+FDD0 ﷐
    V transient character: U+FDD1 ﷑
    J transient character: U+FDD2 ﷒
    R transient character: U+FDD3 ﷓
    A transient character: U+FDD4 ﷔

  //For the DEcoding key, if inputs a, w, and g all decode to output X, then have one of the input string in the array be a regex that matched for a, w, or g. This regex string can be handled just like the other single-character strings, and will work, because all the strings are being put in a regex statement, and the single-character strings are just simple regex statements
  //No symbol for "Z"???
  //No symbol for "Q"???
  //Don't have the symbol for "P" yet
  //No symbol for "J"???
  //"M" is missing backwards Q character
  //Multiple Zodiac characters represent the same latin character. So, for example, A could be converted into like 3 different zodiac characters. Will have to update the function (possibly), to pick between the multiple random characters (maybe randomly, or with some pattern).
    
  //For letters that Zodiac didn't use in his cipher, have them encode to the special "?" character. Have a second encoding key and button/interface (either a seperate div, or possibly have a multi-select input they can choose the method from, sort of like a drop-down form thing?), where you use the multiple-substitution method to make a couple characters also decode to the missing ASCII letters
